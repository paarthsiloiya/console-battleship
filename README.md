## About

A classic command-line Battleship game. Place your ships, guess your opponent's ship locations, and sink their fleet before they sink yours!  
Built for the terminal with a focus on classic grid-based mechanics and a clean, readable interface.

---

## How to Play

- **Cell Position:**  
  Type the row letter followed by the column number (e.g., `A3`, `F5`).  
  No spaces in between.

- **Ship Placement:**  
  Place all five standard ships: Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer.  
  The game first asks you the orientation of the ship, then the starting tile of the ship.

  - **Examples:**

    ```
    CRUISER - with orientation right and starting position D4

         4    5    6    7    8    9
       â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€
     C   â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    â”‚
       â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€
     D   â”‚ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â”‚
       â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€
     E   â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    â”‚    â”‚

	```
	```
    SUBMARINE - with orientation down and starting point E6

         5    6    7
       â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€
     D    â”‚    â”‚
       â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€
     E    â”‚ â–ˆâ–ˆ â”‚
       â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”¼â”€â”€
     F    â”‚ â–ˆâ–ˆ â”‚
       â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â–ˆâ–ˆâ”€â”¼â”€â”€
     G    â”‚ â–ˆâ–ˆ â”‚
       â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€
     H    â”‚    â”‚
    ```

- **Confirming Placement:**  
  After placing all the ships, if you are satisfied with your placements you can confirm it, or you can reset the board and start fresh.

- **Gameplay:**  
  You always start first. To play your move, type out the cell position.  
  If you guessed correctly or incorrectly, a corresponding message will appear.

- **Tracking Progress:**  
  You can keep track of the ships you destroyed by the visual indicator at the top:

  ```
      â¦¿     ðŸž…     ðŸž…     ðŸž…     ðŸž…
  ```

---

## Visual Indicators

- `â–ˆâ–ˆ` : Your ship
- `â–‘â–‘` : Damaged ship
- `ðŸž®` : Hit
- `ðŸž…` : Miss
- `â¦¿` : Destroyed enemy ship

---

## Standard Rules
